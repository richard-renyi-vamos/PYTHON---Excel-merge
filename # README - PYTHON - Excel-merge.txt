create a PYTHON script that merges 2 excels from a sharepoint
ChatGPT
Sure, I can help you with that! 😊 To merge two Excel files from a SharePoint site using Python, you'll need the requests library for authentication and downloading the files, and pandas for reading and merging the Excel files.

Here is a step-by-step guide and the script:

Step 1: Install the required libraries
Make sure you have requests, pandas, and openpyxl installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests pandas openpyxl
Step 2: Python script to merge two Excel files from SharePoint
python
Copy code
import requests
import pandas as pd
from io import BytesIO

# Replace these with your SharePoint and file details
sharepoint_site = 'https://yoursharepointsite.sharepoint.com'
file1_url = 'https://yoursharepointsite.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite/Shared%20Documents/yourfile1.xlsx'
file2_url = 'https://yoursharepointsite.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite/Shared%20Documents/yourfile2.xlsx'
username = 'yourusername@yourdomain.com'
password = 'yourpassword'

# Function to download an Excel file from SharePoint
def download_excel_from_sharepoint(file_url, username, password):
    session = requests.Session()
    session.auth = (username, password)
    response = session.get(file_url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return BytesIO(response.content)

# Download the two Excel files
file1 = download_excel_from_sharepoint(file1_url, username, password)
file2 = download_excel_from_sharepoint(file2_url, username, password)

# Read the Excel files into DataFrames
df1 = pd.read_excel(file1)
df2 = pd.read_excel(file2)

# Merge the DataFrames (this example assumes you want to concatenate them)
merged_df = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)

# Save the merged DataFrame to a new Excel file
merged_df.to_excel('merged_file.xlsx', index=False)

print("The Excel files have been merged and saved as 'merged_file.xlsx'.")
Explanation:
Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary libraries (requests, pandas, and openpyxl) installed.
Define SharePoint and File Details: Replace the placeholders with your actual SharePoint site URL, file URLs, and your credentials.
Download Function: The download_excel_from_sharepoint function handles authentication and downloading of the Excel files from SharePoint.
Read and Merge: The script reads the downloaded Excel files into pandas DataFrames and merges them using pd.concat().
Save Merged File: The merged DataFrame is saved as a new Excel file.
This script will merge the two Excel files from SharePoint and save the result as merged_file.xlsx in your local directory. If you need a different type of merge (e.g., merging based on specific columns), you can adjust the merging part of the script accordingly. 📊🔗😊📈👩‍💻📁✨📑💼🚀
